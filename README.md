A branch of the BizHawk emulator focusing on console verification of TASes and hardware research.

Many cores that I don't plan to maintain / improve / use for console verification have been removed.
Over time only cores that can produce console verified TASes / movies will reamin.

Some features are also removed including cheats, profiles, and libretro.
I want to simplify the code base a bit overtime.
